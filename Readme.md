## Installation

## For Laravel ~5

    composer require collab-corp/laravel-feature-toggle

As with any package, it's a good idea to refresh composer autoloader.
```bash
composer dump-autoload
```

<a name="configuration"/>

## Configuration

To publish `features.php` config file, run the following, `vendor:publish` command.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="\CollabCorp\LaravelFeatureToggle\FeatureToggleServiceProvider"
```

You may then configure your config to your liking, it is possible to use callbacks or callables strings as values.

<a name="binding_callbacks" />

### Binding callbacks
It can become quite cumbersome with a lot of callbacks in your features config,
binding a callback to an alias makes this a breeze.

```php
Feature::bind('evaluation', function ($user, ...$dependencies) {
	// logic.

	return (boolean) $result;
});
```

In addition to letting laravel inject dependencies through the container,
it is also possible to specify values in a comma seperated list.

In your config...
```php 
// config/features.php
<?php return [
	// ...
	'my_feature' => 'env:local,development'
];
```

In your service provider...
```php
Feature::bind('env', function ($user, array $enviroments) {
	return app()->enviroment($enviroments);
});
```


**And you are ready to go.**

<a name="usage" />

## Usage
This package adds the @features blade directive, it outputs JavaScript that adds the feature function to the window.

it is also possible to check a feature inside a blade file, like so
```php
@feature('name')
	// Feature is enabled
@else
	// Feature is disabled
@endfeature
```

In your application code you can simply call 
```php
 use Feature;

 Feature::isEnabled('name');
 Feature::isDisabled('name');
```

### Evaluating features in JavaScript

To evaluate a feature toggle in your frontend, simply add ``` @features ``` to your blade file. Likely in your header.

This will add a ``` bool feature(value) ``` helper to your window.
